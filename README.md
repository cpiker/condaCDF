# condaCDF (In development)

The CDF (Common Data Format) file type has become the standard interchange
mechanism for sharing data in the space physics community.  In addition 
Anaconda is a widely used python virtual environment.  This repository provides
a slightly altered version of the pycdf module from the [SpacePy](https://github.com/spacepy/spacepy)
project along with [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org) packaging for the Goddard Spaceflight Center's CDF binary
libraries to create a standalone CDF reader for python.

## Install

This project is in development.  As soon as a working version is ready,
installation instructions will be provided.  Since there is no new code
development here, it shouldn't take long.
